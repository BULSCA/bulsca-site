        <h2>Reporting Welfare Concerns</h2>
        <p>We all have a <strong>responsibility</strong> to look out for each other. If something does not seem right please
            do raise it as a concern.
            This is the best way to ensure our community and its members are safe and supported. There are two ways in which
            you can raise a concern or report a welfare issue:

            <br>
            <br>
            The first is to email me at <a href="mailto:welfare@bulsca.co.uk" class="link">welfare@bulsca.co.uk</a>. This
            way is by nature not confidential but you can provide as many or as few details as you would like to. This will
            be followed up and dealt with in line with both our policies and your wishes.
            confidentiality and in line with BULSCA policy and your wishes.

            <br>
            <br>
            Alternatively, suppose you would simply like to draw the Welfare Officer’s attention to an issue or incident
            without providing any personal details. In that case, you can do so using the reporting form below:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <div class="flex items-center justify-center">
            <iframe
                src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDnXdmT9k1Xfa95ufxWe0AYQi1rdAw6nPOE2MUiQpsizXheA/viewform"
                class="md:w-[60%] w-[99%] h-[40rem]" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Please be aware that the use of the welfare reporting form does not initiate disciplinary action. It provides
            the opportunity for further support and signposting and the opportunity to raise an issue you feel exists within
            the organisation without providing specific details.</p>
